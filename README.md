1. You'll likely need to add code to the following files:

For navigating to lesson 8 from the /learn-to-play page:

```
src/views/LearnToPlay/LearnToPlay.tsx
```

For adding logic regarding url changes:

```
src/views/Lessons/Puzzles.tsx
```

2. You will want to use local storage to store the last visited lesson 8 page for the user, then you'll need to figure out a way to keep track of the url changes so you can update the local storage value
